- See PDF
- Navigate to Pearson VUE in For test takers tab (https://home.pearsonvue.com/)
- CompTIA blueprint will list the metadata of the exam
- Not all multiple choice questions
- Passing is 720 and above from scale 100-900

### 1. Network Architecture for CompTIA Network
- Introducing network devices
- Understanding network services and applications
- Configuring network services and applications
- Understanding WAN technologies
- Installing and terminating network cables and connectors
- Differentiating between common network topologies
- Differentiating between common network infrastructures
- Implementing a network addressing scheme
- Understanding routing concepts and protocols
- Introducing unified communication technologies
- Comparing cloud and virtualization technologies
- Implementing a basic network

### Objective 1.1 - Explain the Functions and Applications of Various Network Devices 
- Core connectivity devices
- Security devices
- Special purpose devices

#### Hub
- Works at OSI Layer 1 (Physical)
- Hubs are multiport repeaters
  * Regenerate the signal  
- One big collision domain
- Good for network diagnostics and nothing else

#### Switch
- Successor to the bridge
- Works at OSI Layer 2 (Data Link)
  * Can also function at OSI Layer 3 (Network)
- Switches store an in-memory MAC (aka media access control) table and provide dedicated bandwidth to each port (collision domain)

#### Router
- Push my commits to GitHub
- Open a pull request
  * Describe my changes
  * Mention all the members of my team
    * Ask for feedback
