LEARNING PATH DESCRIPTION
===================================================================================
The Big Data trend is flooding the IT landsacape. While big data is getting bigger, new technologies and new ways of analyzing data are being created daily across all industries. Bulding big data solutions is radically different now than it was when it first began. New problems and challenges have manifested which require new solutions and ways to prevent problems from arising. This path will describe various data genres and the management tools that are commonly used in todays big data era. The path will dive into reasons behind the the new big data platforms with common use case scenarios while navigating through models, tests and orchestrations that  assist in predective modeling and system performance across industry sectors


LEARNING PATH AUDIENCE
====================================================================================
This path is designed for Project Managers, Business Intelligence or ETL Developers, Data Architects, Data Analysts and big data enthusiasts interested in a higher comprehension of big data. Some knowledge of big data or data science, data warhouse, ETL or any of the applications/software used in the industry today would be ideal

COURSE DESCRIPTION
========================================================================================
In the past decade the amount of data being created has increased signifigantly with terabytes of data being generated almost every second, the rate of data creation only accelerating. This growth has affected businesses and how they handle data. To tackle the new challenges of big data comes a new generation of technologies to help leading industries with their data. This course will go through the types of challenges being faced in the day to day by rethinking data systems from the ground up. The course will cover in depth topics such as monitoring tools and orchestrations, performance modeling, testing and predective analysis with some real life use cases and scenarios using the latest applications and software being used in the industry today

GOAL
=======================================================================================
To become familiar with the latest trends, current challenges being faced in the leading industries today, identify the frequent data operations required for various types of data including analysis, testing and prevention of some of the major issues being faced in the field



KEYWORDS
=======================================================================================
